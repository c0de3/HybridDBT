	*    -> initialDestination: address where the jump led in MIPS binaries
	*    -> type: is it an absolute or a relative jump
	*
	* We need to find the correct immediate value to insert in the instruction. For this, we need to find the index
	* of the new destination. We will process iteratively by considering the initial address and increasing its
	* value for each insertion done by the translator (and stored in array called 'insertions'.
	*
	* TODO: if we allow the splitting of the binaries to translate into several smaller pieces, we will need to
	* check here if the destination is translated or not.
	*
	* Note: Insertions from memory 'insertions' contains addresses with the offset placeCode already applied

	/**
	 * Idea of the procedure:
	 * The procedure will go through all instruction of the MIPS binaries and translate them into VLIW binaries.
	 * This translation is naive and do not try to exploit ILP.
	 *
	 * There are two important variables used in the main loop:
	 *   - indexInSourceBinaries: index of the MIPS binary instruction being treated. This variable is not increased
	 *     when we meet a duplicated instruction (eg. a MIPS instruction turned into two VLIW instructions).
	 *     Initial value is zero.
	 *   - indexInDestinationBinaries: index if the written VLIW instruction. This variable is not updated when we meet
	 *     a dropped instruction (eg. an instruction that will not be translated in the VLIW binaries, like the
	 *     mult instruction which will be translated when a mfhi/mflo is met). Initial value is zero.
	 *
	 * Loop also compute other information:
	 *   - Data on the loop and procedure boundaries: This is information on the limits of all blocks and procedures.
	 *     Effectively, each time we meet a jump/branch, we store the possible destinations as starting points of
	 *     blocks. For example, a JUMP instruction will lead to a single starting point at the targeted address.
	 *     On the contrary, a conditional branch will generate two starting points, one at the destination address and
	 *     the other one after the branch.
	 *     WARNING: on MIPS binaries, the instruction following the jump is executed so we have to place the limit at
	 *     the correct place.
	 *     This data is collected using the variables 'blocksBoundaries' and 'proceduresBoundaries'.
	 *     NOTE: the place where the block boundary is placed use the index in SOURCE binaries.
	 *
	 *   - Data on the unresolved jumps: As we cannot know the destination of jumps instruction we meet, we will
	 *     mark them as unresolved during generation. When the complete binaries are generated, we will go through
	 *     these jumps and solved the address, taking into account inserted and suppressed instructions.
	 *     Two variables are used to keep track of insertions and suppressions: 'insertions' and 'numberInsertions'.
	 *     Note that a negative value in 'insertion' is the place of a suppressed instruction.
	 *     NOTE: values in insertions are the place of the inserted instruction in DESTINATION binaries.
	 *     Four other variables are used to register unresolved jumps: 'unresolvedJumps_src' is the address in DESTINATION
	 *     binaries of the jump to solve, 'unresolvedJumps_type' contain information on the jump type (absolute or
	 *     relative), 'unresolvedJumps' contains the destination address in the SOURCE binaries and numberUnresolvedJumps
	 *     contains the number of jumps being registered.
